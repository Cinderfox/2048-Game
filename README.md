## Introduction

The Even-Length Palindromic Substring Detection with Eertree program demonstrates how the Eertree data structure can be utilized to efficiently identify even-length palindromic substrings in a given string.

## Features

This program offers the following features:

- Efficient Detection: The Eertree data structure efficiently detects even-length palindromic substrings.
- Insertion Algorithm: The program uses an efficient insertion algorithm to build the Eertree.
- Print Functionality: It provides the capability to print all the even-length palindromic substrings present in the input string.

## Installation

To use the Even-Length Palindromic Substring Detection program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. No additional libraries or dependencies are required.

## Usage

1. Run the program using a Python interpreter: `python eertree_palindrome.py`.
2. Observe the detected even-length palindromic substrings in the output.

## Eertree

The Eertree is a specialized tree structure that helps in efficiently detecting even-length palindromic substrings in a string.

## Insertion Algorithm

The insertion algorithm efficiently constructs the Eertree. For each character in the input string, it checks for palindromic properties and updates the Eertree accordingly.

## Printing Even-Length Palindromes

The program provides a function to print all the detected even-length palindromic substrings. This function demonstrates the effectiveness of the Eertree in identifying palindromes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
